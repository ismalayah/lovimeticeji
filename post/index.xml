In fact, it’s too bad we don’t get more time with Sarsgaard in the center of the film because he understands how to embrace a villain.</description></item><item><title>Is Jake dead during Adventure Time spin-off Fionna &amp;amp; Cake?</title><link>/is-jake-dead-during-adventure-time-spinoff-fionna-cake.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/is-jake-dead-during-adventure-time-spinoff-fionna-cake.html</guid><description>In the summer of 2023, Max released its Adventure Time&amp;nbsp;spin-off&amp;nbsp;Fionna &amp;amp; Cake, starring the fictional characters that Ice King (now, Simon Petrikov) created during the original show.
