I like the first Shrek, and love Kung Fu Panda, but have never cared much for the rest of their output; even when they aren’t churning out an endless assembly line of lazy sequels, I am turned off by the broad, pandering, flagrantly commercial attitude with which most of their films are produced. I have rarely gotten any sense of wonder out of DreamWorks films, any of the immediate life and vitality that fuels the best animation has to offer.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>This, more than anything else, is what <strong>Rise of the Guardians </strong>gets right. It is a bold, wildly inventive, and extremely heartfelt love letter to the fantasy of childhood, made with passion, enthusiasm, and relentless creative energy. There is a strong, tangible soul behind each bold image of magic and darkness, or at the core of every vivid character, and I found myself quickly swept up in the spirit of the production.</p><p data-characters=912 data-current-count=912 data-injectable=true>Director Peter Ramsey establishes a thoughtful, reverential tone from the very first scene, which depicts the sudden birth of Jack Frost, mythical arbiter of snow and ice, on a quiet winter’s night. The scene is a little different than anything I have seen in modern American animation, a quietly beautiful, subtly haunting portrait of magic, spectacle, and, as Frost is quickly dismayed to find that the people of earth cannot see or talk to him, doubt. It’s the sort of smart, delicate tone I could never imagine DreamWorks committing to for an entire movie, but for the most part, this is how <strong>Rise of the Guardians </strong>plays. It is more overtly humorous at times, and more devoted to action and thrills at others – and falters, occasionally, when it moves too far in this direction – but on the whole, this is high-fantasy done seriously, and I cannot respect Ramsey and his team enough for that decision.</p><p data-characters=619 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>Frost is our protagonist, it turns out, for after we skip ahead several centuries, he has been appointed – by the silent, God-like ‘man in the moon – earth’s newest ‘Guardian.’ The Guardians are well known to all of us as the mythical beings of childhood: Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and so on. Each is a main character in this movie, and when the nefarious Boogeyman reappears after centuries in hiding, attempting to instill fear in children around the world, these Guardians must accept Frost as their unlikely newest member in hopes of restoring belief around the globe.</p><p data-characters=618 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>The concept sounds silly on paper, to be frank, and that is why the reverent tone is so important. If <strong>Rise of the Guardians </strong>were merely a vehicle for cheap laughs, cashing in on familiar holiday tropes and iconic storybook personalities, it would be a creative failure. Instead, the film has something very poignant to say about how and why children believe in these figures, and why the ability to believe is central to the childhood experience. Each character is vividly realized and uniquely interpreted, and the film argues rather powerfully, and insightfully, for why each has a place in our collective mythology.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><a href=#><img decoding=async title=rise-of-the-guardians src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/rise-of-the-guardians.jpg alt width=600 height=338 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p data-characters=1025 data-current-count=1025 data-injectable=true>Guillermo del Toro served as creative consultant and executive producer on this project, and one can definitely sense his stylistic playfulness and eye for subverting iconography in the DNA of the film. Combine that with author William Joyce’s distinctive source material, and it seems that Ramsey and his artists had plenty of encouragement to be bold with their imaginations. The film reinvents each of its central characters in the most clever and detailed ways imaginable, crafting whole sub-worlds for Santa, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny that could easily stand on their own as the basis for individual films. The last decade has seen a lot of ‘reimaginings’ of Santa’s workshop, in films like The Santa Clause, The Polar Express, and Elf, but I am far more fascinated by how <strong>Rise of the Guardians </strong>handles the North Pole, and that is only one fraction of the film’s larger tapestry. The dramatic value the film gets out of a concept as silly as the tooth fairy, for instance, is absolutely remarkable.</p><p data-characters=627 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>Still, the most impressive reinvention here is Jack Frost, a character I have never found compelling on even the most basic conceptual levels. <strong>Rise of the Guardians </strong>transforms him into a wonderful protagonist, one whose powers – realized with breathtaking visual ingenuity – lend him doubt, and whose doubt makes him human. He’s the film’s touchstone character, the one children and, I suspect, many grown-ups will relate to, and if his arc is a familiar one – the lost rebel who finds his place in the world – the story is told with such heart and passion that the big emotional beats still hit very close to home.</p><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>Chris Pine is excellent in the role, doing nice understated work that never draws attention away from the animation. The voice work is terrific across the board, in fact, each performer melding perfectly with their character. I love that Alec Baldwin plays Santa as Russian – why this has not been done before in a mainstream movie eludes me – and that Hugh Jackman gets to use his native – and awesome – Australian accent for a very feisty interpretation of the Easter Bunny. As the Boogeyman, Jude Law is equally smart casting, hitting notes both fun and menacing in what could easily be a one-note part.</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>I wish I could say more about the film’s seemingly gorgeous animation, but the screening I attended had a severely dim projector, and with the extra darkness of 3D on top of that, the image was often quite difficult to see. The 3D is technically excellent, clear and immersive at all times, but as usual, I recommend going 2D on this one, especially in an age where we cannot trust major theatre chains to change out bulbs regularly. In any case, the visuals are extremely appealing, sporting a distinctive, storybook style and bursting with detail at every turn.</p><p data-characters=650 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true><strong>Rise of the Guardians </strong>is not quite the best animated feature of the year – that title still belongs to Wreck-It Ralph – but I commend DreamWorks for stepping outside their comfort zone, delivering top-notch children’s entertainment made with artistic clarity and genuine vision. This is the sort of film I can easily see kids falling in love with, and one that opens more discussion paths for parents than ‘wasn’t the zebra funny?’ Between this, <a href=#>Wreck-It Ralph</a>, and <a href=#>Life of Pi</a>, families have several great choices for smart and fulfilling entertainment this Thanksgiving, and I hope audiences take advantage of all the quality on display.</p><p data-characters=42 data-current-count=42 data-injectable=false>Sorry, the video is currently unavailable.</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-half></span><h5 class=review-rating>Fantastic</h5><p class=review-summary>Rise of the Guardians is an unexpected treat, a clever and heartfelt love letter to the wonder of childhood that should delight audiences of all ages this Thanksgiving.</p><p class=review-title>Rise Of The Guardians Review</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqaKrlWK0tq3RnaCapqNiv6bCyJ6uaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-the-santa-claus-killer-and-how-did-he-tear-a-community-apart.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is the Santa Claus Killer, and how did he tear a community apart?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kay-robertson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kay Robertson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./has-tanqr-done-a-face-reveal-facts-to-know-about-the-youtuber.html>Has Tanqr Done A Face Reveal?
