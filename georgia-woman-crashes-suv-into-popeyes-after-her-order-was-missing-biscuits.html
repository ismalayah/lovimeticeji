The sheriff’s deputies were called to the chicken restaurant over an accident with injuries.</p><p>The manager made an astounding revelation when he told the authorities that Miller’s order was corrected, and she received her biscuits before the incident, but Miller “was still not happy.”</p><p>According to the report, Miller’s action was not entirely unforeseen. Before the incident, the woman threatened the restaurant’s staff, even calling and threatening to drive her car into the building.</p><p>One of the employees, standing by the entrance, was almost struck by the car during the incident, noted deputies.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the incident report, a witness allegedly waiting in line with Miller was told to hurry and get their order “because she was coming back.”</p><p>Miller returned and allegedly drove her SUV into the chicken restaurant, narrowly missing an 18-year-old employee.</p><p>According to arrest warrants, Miller continued driving after hitting and entering the building until her car was stopped by debris.</p><p>After crashing into the restaurant, Miller fled the scene, according to the report. Her car was discovered at her home with front-end damage.</p><p>According to the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office, Miller was booked into the Charles B. Webster Detention Center on Wednesday, four days after the alleged incident.&nbsp;</p><p>No one knows what was going on in Miller’s mind when she did this, and it’s unknown if she feels any guilt or remorse after being arrested.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCzxKipoKGRYsSwucCnZJyqkai1pr%2BMrKyvZZmjwbB5z6innrGVqHqistOeqWaglad6sL7Dnqlmr5Goeq610qygp59dl7a0r9Siq6xn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gina-debose-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-200831-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gina DeBose Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-powter-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daniel Powters biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./has-tanqr-done-a-face-reveal-facts-to-know-about-the-youtuber.html>Has Tanqr Done A Face Reveal?
