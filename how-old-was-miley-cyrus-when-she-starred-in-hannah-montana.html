Premiering in March of 2006, Hannah Montana was an instant success for the channel on the heels of High School Musical‘s debut. A lot of the success is thanks to the charm and talent Cyrus brought to the titular role, though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it almost looked a lot different.</a> The show ran for 4 seasons from 2006 to 2011, racking up nearly 100 episodes, a theatrical film, and a world tour and accompanying concert film.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>So it may come as a surprise to many that Cyrus was barely a teenager when first putting on Hannah’s blonde wig. Disney first green-lit Hannah Montana in August of 2005, meaning Cyrus filmed the show’s pilot episode when she was only 13 years old. Considering the show ended in 2011, Cyrus spent the entirety of her teen years balancing not only the music career of the fictional Hannah, but her own career as well.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Over a 4 year span, Cyrus released 5 albums as Hannah Montana and 3 as Miley Cyrus, as well as a live album from the Best of Both Worlds tour. In addition to the insane amount of music she performed, and filming everything Hannah, she also starred in Bolt and The Last Song during her time on Disney.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true><a title=@mileycyrus href=#>@mileycyrus</a><p>Used To Be Young (Series) – PART 12</p><a title="♬ Used To Be Young - Miley Cyrus" href=#>♬ Used To Be Young – Miley Cyrus</a></figure><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>In her social media series promoting her song “Used to be Young,” Cyrus touches on the stress she was put under at such a young age <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">because of the role</a>. Breaking down the average schedule she had from week to week, she joking said that “this girl deserves a little endless summer vacation,” a reference to her latest album titled Endless Summer Vacation.</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=851 data-injectable=true>Throughout the series, Cyrus touches on many moments of controversy throughout her career. She recognizes a lot of the controversy stemmed from the fact she was known as a teen-friendly pop star and people wanted her to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stay in that box</a>, even as she grew up. Discussing the infamous 2008 Vanity Fair cover, Cyrus said “This image of me is the complete opposite of the bubblegum pop star that I had been known for being. And that’s what was so upsetting.”</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Even though she started in the business at a young age, Cyrus has yet to slow down her success. At the 2024 Grammys, Cyrus took home not only her first Grammy award for Best Pop Solo Performance for “Flowers,” but a second one for Record of the Year for the same song.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMqKOdZaeWwG65yKWcsmWTrr%2B2v4ywn56mXai1pnnSrZirqpWZeqq6jKGYp6aRnXquu82tmKeZXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stuart-antony.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stuart Antony- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./every-scott-pilgrim-comic-to-read-before-netflixs-scott-pilgrim-takes-off.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Every Scott Pilgrim comic to read before Netflixs Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./has-tanqr-done-a-face-reveal-facts-to-know-about-the-youtuber.html>Has Tanqr Done A Face Reveal?
