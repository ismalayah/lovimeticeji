The Dark Knight Rises actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt is scheduled to play former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in the first chapter of the new series The Battle for Uber. This gripping drama series, developed by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, also stars Kerry Bishé, Babak Tafti, Uma Thurman, Elisabeth Shue, Kyle Chandler, and numerous more talented performers. It is based on Mike Isaac’s best-selling book ‘Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber.’ According to reports, Quentin Tarantino will act as the series’ narrator for the first season.</p><h2>A Look Into Travis Kalanick’s Net Worth</h2><p>Travis Kalanick, well known as Uber’s contentious co-founder and former CEO, is the subject of the first chapter of the new drama series Super Pumped. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he is an American entrepreneur with a net worth of $3 billion as of October 2023. Kalanick co-founded Uber in 2009, a smartphone application for seeking rides and person-to-person vehicle rentals in major cities. The firm is now operating in hundreds of locations across the globe, and the concept has been adopted by numerous other similar types of ridesharing services. The company’s phenomenal success elevated Travis Kalanick to one of the tech industry’s most influential and controversial CEOs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Travis-Kalanick-2.jpg alt="Travis Kalanick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Uber secured a massive financing round in June 2014, valued at around $18.2 billion. The investment totaled $1.6 billion in funding from various sources, the most notable of which is the mutual fund Fidelity Investments. Kalanick officially became a billionaire for the first time at that value, with an implied ownership share of around 5.55 percent. As a private firm, Uber was valued at up to $120 billion at its height. On paper, Travis Kalanick was now worth about $6 billion.</p><p>After a barrage of issues, Kalanick, the subject of the Showtime documentary, was forced to quit his prestigious position as CEO of the business in June 2017. For more than a year, Uber has been plagued by problems. Travis Kalanick sold around 30% of his shares worth $1.4 billion to Softbank, a Japanese investment behemoth, shortly after quitting his critical position in the business. That whole deal, along with preceding private transactions, formally made Kalanick a liquid billionaire, as detailed further in Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Travis-Kalanick-3.jpg alt="Travis Kalanick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On May 10, 2019, the firm went public. Uber was valued at around $77 billion after the transaction. Kalanick’s remaining Uber shares were valued at roughly $4.9 billion. He also sold around 3.7 million shares in the IPO, generating almost $170 million in cash. In December 2019, Uber’s former CEO announced that he was leaving the firm entirely. He also claimed that he had sold about 90% of his stock. Kalanick received around $2.7 billion in revenues from selling his shares. Fast forward to December 2020, and Uber’s prospects have improved substantially, with the stock price worth more than $54 on December 4, 2020. Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber, based on the spectacular rise and fall of Uber’s previous CEO, premieres on Showtime on February 27, 2022.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmasopbDqr%2BMpJilmZ6esKx7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kerry-westcott.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kerry Westcott movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sabrina-ferilli.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sabrina Ferilli movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./has-tanqr-done-a-face-reveal-facts-to-know-about-the-youtuber.html>Has Tanqr Done A Face Reveal?
