The Maroon 5 frontman has been rocking out for almost three decades, but now a new aspect of his life is taking center stage: His texting habits to women who aren’t his wife.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>In the age of social media it was only a matter of time before word got out that Levine had a habit of engaging in flirtatious conversations with attractive women online. Following <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">allegations of an affair</a> from Instagram model <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sumner Stroh</a>, Levine addressed his salacious behavior with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">regret</a>, committing to make things work with his wife, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Behati Prinsloo</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>However, more women have come forward corroborating Stroh’s claims, bringing with them a host of <a href=#>unbecoming receipts</a>. Let’s take a deep dive into the 15-year-old’s – ahem, excuse us, we mean 43-year old’s most cringe-worthy texts.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-watching-your-ass-jiggle-on-that-table-will-permanently-scar-me data-injectable=false>“Watching your ass jiggle on that table will permanently scar me”</h2><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>Why not start out with a bang? Levine sent this text to Instagram model @mvrykv_ during an undisclosed period of time either before or after his interactions with Sumner Stroh. It’s undoubtedly one of the more embarrassing texts of the bunch, and unfortunately it doesn’t stop there.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-i-d-buy-a-steak-dinner-and-whisper-sweet-nothings-to-it data-injectable=false>“I’d buy a steak dinner and whisper sweet nothings to it”</h2><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>This text, in case you were wondering, is in reference to Instagram model @mvrykv_. And yes, he said he’d like to whisper sweet nothings to her butt. We apologize in advance for any cringes this may have elicited.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-i-may-need-to-see-the-booty data-injectable=false>“I may need to see the booty.”</h2><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>No context needed here. He simply wants to see the booty. This one was yet again sent to @mvrykv_, and if he weren’t 43 years old, it might actually be funny.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-i-m-having-another-baby-wifey-pregnant-and-i-m-having-a-boy-and-i-m-naming-him-zea-he-will-be-a-badass data-injectable=false>“I’m having another baby. Wifey pregnant! And I’m having a BOY. And I’m naming him Zea. He will be a badass.”</h2><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>The reference to asses continues, although this time about his son, who Levine hopes will be, like him, a supposed badass. Also, why he feels the need to talk to other women — in this case @mvrykv_ — about his and his wife’s son is unclear.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-that-body-of-yours-is-absurd data-injectable=false>“That body of yours is absurd”</h2><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>Again, were he not a 43-year-old father of two in a committed relationship with his wife, this text might possibly be acceptable between two teenagers looking to get frisky for the first time. Alas, it’s not.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-are-you-such-an-hourglass data-injectable=false>“How are you such an hourglass?”</h2><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>You can classify this one next to the pick-up line, “Did you fall from heaven because you look like an angel.” Levine sent it — yet again — to @mvrykv_.</p><h2 id=h-i-m-now-obsessed-with-you data-injectable=false>“I’m now obsessed with you.”</h2><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>Public service announcement to any young person searching for love: A suitor claiming to be obsessed with you is a red <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">flag</a>, plain and simple. @mvrykv_ responded to this with, “Dude aren’t you like married?” Yes. Yes, he is.</p><h2 id=h-distract-yourself-by-f-with-me data-injectable=false>“Distract yourself by f****** with me.”</h2><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>This text between Levine and @mvrykv_ was one of the first ones to attract public attention following news that Levine talked with more women than just Sumner Stroh. While he may not have meant the literal act of faithfulness, it does cause concern that his way of passing the time is by talking to other women.</p><h2 id=h-i-shouldn-t-be-talking-to-you-you-know-that-right data-injectable=false>“I shouldn’t be talking to you you know [that] right?”</h2><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>Here’s a thought: Then maybe you shouldn’t…? Levine sent this stomach-churning text to Alyson Rosef, one of the women who came forward with screenshotted proof of his unsettling online behavior.</p><h2 id=h-you-are-50-times-hotter-in-person-and-so-am-i data-injectable=false>“You are 50 times hotter in person… And so am I”</h2><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Flirting tip: It’s best not to&nbsp;compliment yourself in the same breath as hitting on someone. It’s — shall we say — a little douchey. Levine sent this message to Sumner Stroh and contradicts his claims that things remained strictly online and he didn’t have an in-person affair.</p><h2 id=h-it-is-truly-unreal-how-f-hot-you-are-like-it-blows-my-mind data-injectable=false>“It is truly unreal how f****** hot you are. Like it blows my mind.”</h2><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>If it feels like Levine is coming off intense, you’re not alone. It’s a common theme among many of his salacious texts to Sumner Stroh and this is just another example of paying attention to red flags when you see them.</p><h2 id=h-ok-serious-question-i-m-having-another-baby-and-if-it-s-a-boy-i-really-wanna-name-it-sumner-you-ok-with-that-dead-serious data-injectable=false>“Ok serious question. I’m having another baby and if it’s [a] boy I really wanna name it Sumner. You ok with that? DEAD serious.”</h2><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=false>Ending on the most disturbing note of all, here we have a text Levine supposedly sent to Sumner Stroh months after their alleged affair.&nbsp;It’s unknown whether this was before or after he told @mvrykv_ he was thinking about naming his son Zea. The idea of Levine asking his alleged former mistress if he could name his unborn son after her is something straight out of a movie. Or a song. Either way, it’s disturbing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S0s63BZphmmpGns26uwKBkmqtdrLJusM5mmGaclZq9brDIr5xmoZ6pvG6tw5qkZqSVq7avsdJmq56wpJ67qHnHmpmirKNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./warner-bros-exploring-idea-allstar-superman-movie-starring-jon-hamm.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WB Wants To Do An All-Star Superman Movie With Jon Hamm</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-wonka-ending-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Wonka ending explained</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./has-tanqr-done-a-face-reveal-facts-to-know-about-the-youtuber.html>Has Tanqr Done A Face Reveal?
