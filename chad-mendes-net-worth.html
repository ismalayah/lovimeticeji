He recently held the number 4 ranking in the UFC featherweight division, and his dedication to the sport has significantly contributed to his current net worth.</p><p>As of mid-2016, Chad Mendes has amassed a net worth of approximately $1.5 million, primarily from his successful career in mixed martial arts. His journey commenced during high school, and he has competed in over 20 professional mixed martial arts matches. It is anticipated that his wealth will continue to grow as he progresses in his career.</p><h3>Chad Mendes Net Worth $1.5 million</h3><p>Chad attended Hanford High School, where he actively participated in wrestling. His skills notably improved over the years, culminating in a respectable 3rd place finish during his senior year and earning him the Cadet All-American honor. Subsequently, he pursued his education at Cal Poly and achieved an outstanding wrestling record of 64-14. His remarkable senior year performance, with a record of 30-1, secured him a second-place position in the 2008 NCAA championships. Following his college years, he chose to train with the mixed martial arts team, Alpha Male, and joined the Palace Fighting Championship, where he maintained an undefeated record.</p><p>In March 2010, Chad joined the World Extreme Cagefighting and marked a strong debut with a victory via unanimous decision. He continued his impressive run in 2010, securing victories against Anthony Morrison, Cub Swanson, and Javier Vazquez. Notably, his victory against Vazquez was achieved utilizing an unorthodox front flip while Vazquez was on the ground. With the merger of World Extreme Cagefighting and Ultimate Fighting Championship, Mendes transitioned to the UFC along with other fighters. His first fight in the UFC was against judo black belt Michihiro Omigawa in February 2011, which he won via unanimous decision. Although originally slated to face UFC featherweight champion Jose Aldo, he encountered Rani Yanya due to Aldo’s injuries, claiming another victory.</p><p>In January 2012, Mendes competed against Aldo for the championship title but suffered a defeat in the first round, marking his first professional loss. He rebounded in July 2012 with a victory over Cody McKenzie via knockout. Subsequently, he secured wins against Yaotzin Meza and Darren Elkins in 2012 and against Clay Guida and Nik Lentz in 2013. Despite experiencing a loss against Aldo in a rematch, Mendes extended his contract after a victory against Ricardo Lamas. He encountered Conor McGregor in a fight as a replacement for Aldo and faced another defeat. In late 2015, he also suffered a loss against Frankie Edgar and was later subject to an investigation for a potential doping violation.</p><p>In his personal life, Mendes faced legal troubles after being charged with battery stemming from a bar fight, although the charges were eventually dropped. He was, however, fined for public disturbance, and he has maintained a private stance in regards to his relationships.</p><p><br>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Chad Mendes</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 1, 1986</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Hanford, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.68 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>66 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Mixed Martial Artist</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>California Polytechnic State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/ChadMoneyMendes</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/chadmendes</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/chadmendes/</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4206642/</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>UFC 200 Greatest Fighters of All Time</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Sports: AT&T Original Documentaries</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>World Series of Fighting 26: Palmer vs. Almeida</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself – Lance Palmer’s Corner</td></tr><tr><td>UFC on Fox</td><td>2012-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>UFC Fight Flashback</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>UFC Embedded: Vlog Series</td><td>2014-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself / Himself – UFC #3 Featherweight</td></tr><tr><td>UFC 189: Mendes vs. McGregor</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Countdown to UFC</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>UFC’s Top 5 Greatest Fights</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>UFC Ultimate Insider</td><td>2013-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself / Himself – UFC Featherweight</td></tr><tr><td>World Series of Fighting 16: Palhares vs. Fitch</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself – Audience Member</td></tr><tr><td>UFC 179: Aldo vs. Mendes II</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>American Latino TV</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>UFC 142: Aldo vs. Mendes</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>World Extreme Cagefighting</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><p><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiaoZmUYrqmusOeqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-doyle-murray.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Doyle-Murray movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./after-everything-2018.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>After Everything movie review (2018)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./has-tanqr-done-a-face-reveal-facts-to-know-about-the-youtuber.html>Has Tanqr Done A Face Reveal?
