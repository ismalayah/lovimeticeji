It became even bleaker after fans learned that the series wouldn’t stop with Cavill’s departure, but instead be carried on by Australian actor and brother to the God of Thunder himself, Liam Hemsworth.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Cavill’s departure has been met with such severity that a petition has gone around <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">demanding the showrunners be fired</a> and Hemsworth prevented from stepping in as the next White Wolf, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as we learned from Game of Thrones</a>, that’s unlikely to happen.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=830 data-injectable=true>That’s where <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mads Mikkelsen</a></strong> comes into play. Like Hemsworth, Mikkelsen auditioned for the part of Geralt alongside Cavill, but unlike Hemsworth, Mikkelsen was actually the top choice to play the character. As we know, the role ultimately went to Cavill, which was obviously the right choice – Cavill is, after all, the perfect Geralt, made even more perfect by his own admiration for the franchise – but the 39-year-old English actor is officially trading Geralt’s sword for Superman’s cape and there’s no use beating a dead horse over the issue any longer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>That being said, Mikkelsen’s talents <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">necessitate acknowledgment</a>. Through his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">various roles</a> in Hannibal, The Hunt, and Casino Royale, the Danish actor has proven himself to be a versatile veteran of the craft.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, Mikkelsen won’t become the next Geralt of Rivia (unless Netflix has a major change of heart). However, that hasn’t stopped us from dream-casting him in other Witcher roles, many of which he would positively excel in.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>Without further ado, here are six characters from The Witcher universe that we think would be an absolute home run for Mikkelsen.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-isengrim-faoiltiarna data-injectable=false>Isengrim Faoiltiarna</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Isengrim-Faoiltiarna-The-Witcher.jpeg><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false>If he can’t be the White Wolf, let him be the Iron Wolf.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>In the series, Isengrum Faoiltiarna was an elf and member of the Scoia’tael who played a part in the attack on the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and was also responsible for the capture of Cahir, the officer of the Nilfgaardian Empire who appeared in both seasons one and two of the Netflix show. Isengrum was also the Colonel of the Vrihedd Brigade in the Battle of Brenna. He hasn’t appeared yet in the show so it’s not too late to bring him on board.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-leo-bonhart data-injectable=false>Leo Bonhart</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Leo-bonhart-The-Witcher.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Mikkelsen’s rough-around-the-edges appearance makes him a perfect casting choice for Leo Bonhart. In the series, Bonhart was a bounty hunter for hire who killed not one, not two, but three witchers in his lifetime, and was even hired to kill Ciri. Best of all, he kept each witcher’s medallion as trophies.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-stefan-skellen data-injectable=false>Stefan Skellen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Stefan-Skellen-The-Witcher.jpg><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>If not a bounty hunter, let Mikkelsen be the one who does the hiring. In the series, Stefan Skellen was a member of the Imperial Secret Service tasked by Emperor Emhyr to capture Ciri. Stefan employed the skill of mercenaries like Leo Bonhart to do his bidding, and it’d be a real treat to see Mikkelsen play this kind of behind-the-scenes calculated character.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-iorweth data-injectable=false>Iorweth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Iorweth-The-Witcher.jpg><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>In keeping with the Scoia’tael, Mikkelsen could easily play Iorweth, a skilled hunter and elf who was famous for his burning hatred of humans. Although Iorweth didn’t have the biggest part to play, his ruthless demeanor and idealist notions made him a memorable character that Mikkelsen could breathe even more life into. Plus, seeing him battle it out with Geralt would be a sight for sore eyes.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-eredin-breacc-glas data-injectable=false>Eredin Bréacc Glas</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Withcer-TheWildHunt.jpg><p data-characters=648 data-current-count=948 data-injectable=true>We know what you’re thinking. This character would waste Mikkelsen’s talents by hiding his face and body behind intricate black armor and a helmet. But the commander of the Wild Hunt? Mikkelsen would absolutely smash this role. Plus, now that the Wild Hunt was officially introduced at the end of season two, there is some great source material on the horizon for the character, including trying to capture Ciri and use her to open up all the gates to the different worlds so he can rule them all. If you’re going to introduce one of the strongest characters in the franchise, at least give it to a talented actor like Mikkelsen. Just saying.</p><h2 id=h-vesemir data-injectable=false>Vesemir</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vesemir-Kim-Bodina-The-Witcher.jpg><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=false>Okay, we know what you’re thinking, but consider this one dream casting. We know Vesemir is already played by Kim Bodnia – who is spectacular in the role, yes – but hey, if we’re recasting people, why not just go for the jugular and recast Vesemir? No bad blood towards Bodnia, we just know Mikkelsen would knock the role out of the park.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ymwsSnZKKeXZ2ybrDOnqqnrF2luaLFjKCcq5mcqXqwsoyroK%2BhkWK1pr7EZpirnV1reqS0wKuYnKyVp8BustGopGasmJp6uLXTnJ%2Beql2irqW%2FjKagpKOVocCmuoycpq6klGLAsbHCrZicrZyWv63FjJ6km6eUrnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sapphire-adventures.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sapphire (Adventures) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uncle-boonmee-who-can-recall-his-past-lives-2011.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives movie review (2011)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./has-tanqr-done-a-face-reveal-facts-to-know-about-the-youtuber.html>Has Tanqr Done A Face Reveal?
