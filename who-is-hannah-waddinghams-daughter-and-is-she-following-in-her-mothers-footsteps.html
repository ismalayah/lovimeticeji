Waddingham, however, is also a mom — here’s what’s known about Waddingham’s daughter, Kitty, and whether Kitty will follow her mother’s footsteps into acting.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>On the topic of being a parent, Waddingham revealed that the Welton part was a godsend even before the accolades came rolling in, as the character allowed her to be closer to her young daughter. As an actress, Waddingham, a single mom, was used to traveling for work and spending long periods away from home. Ted Lasso, however, films near where Waddingham lives in England. For this reason, Welton couldn’t have come at a better time, Waddingham said.</p><h2 id=h-what-do-we-know-about-waddingham-s-daughter-kitty data-injectable=false><strong>What do we know about Waddingham’s daughter, Kitty?</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>As Hannah Waddingham explained on the White Wine Question Time podcast and The Ellen Degeneres Show, her daughter Kitty, born in 2016, has an autoimmune disorder <a href=#>Henoch-Schönlein purpura</a>, or HSP. HSP can cause blood vessels to swell and burst and form a rash. People typically recover, but kidney problems sometimes persist.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>Speaking with Degeneres, Waddingham said that once Kitty was diagnosed, she asked the universe for a part that would keep her closer to Kitty.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Speaking to the powers that be, Waddingham said, ” … [C]an I just ask you for something that is close to home so I can do my main role, which is to be mama. And also can I ask that it’s something that really shows what I can do [as an actress]. And I hope that’s not asking too much” (via Daily Mail).</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=119 data-injectable=false>A few months later, Waddingham was cast as Welton, and Lasso filmed less than an hour away from where Waddingham lived.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Otherwise, not much else is known about Hannah Waddingham’s only daughter. As mentioned, she was born in 2016, making her still young, and understandably, <a href=#>Waddingham, who was 49 in 2023</a>, keeps her out of the spotlight.</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Waddingham does, however, share photos of Kitty on social media, with her face turned away from the camera, to protect her privacy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Hannah Waddingham (@hannah_waddingham)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>It’s also too soon to know if Kitty is interested in acting or singing. While promoting her 2023 holiday special, Hannah Waddingham: Home for Christmas on Late Night with Seth Meyers, however, Waddingham did indicate Kitty did have a taste for show business.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>According to her mom, Kitty requested one guest star for her mother’s festive outing: Hamilton‘s Leslie Odom Jr., Waddingham said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>via Late Night with Seth Meyers/NBC/YouTube</figure><h2 id=h-who-is-kitty-s-father data-injectable=false>Who is Kitty’s father?</h2><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>One final detail that is known about Hannah Waddingham’s daughter, Kitty: Her father is Italian <a href=#>Gianluca Cugnetto</a>. Cugnetto and Waddingham were together more than ten years before their relationship ended. They never married.</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=false>As for Kitty’s mom, Ted Lasso season 3, the show’s final season, was released in 2023. Late that same year, <a href=#>Deadline</a> reported Waddingham would next appear alongside Octavia Spencer in an unnamed new comedy series on Prime from Tessa Coates. A Lasso spinoff starring Waddingham as Rebecca Welton was reportedly shelved, Deadline added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmoJGju6K0jLCYnZyZo7SprcysZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZpinnF2ewG6%2Fx55kn6ecoby4tc2gZKKmXZ2ys3nMqKuhnaKoeqe7zq2qrZ2gqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./black-panther-2-crew-merch-drops-more-namor-breadcrumbs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Black Panther 2 crew merch drops more Namor breadcrumbs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-still-pinching-herself-after-wwe-paired-her-with-her-real-life-boyfriend-madcap-moss.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emma Still Pinching Herself After WWE Paired Her With Her Real-Life Boyfriend Madcap Moss</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./has-tanqr-done-a-face-reveal-facts-to-know-about-the-youtuber.html>Has Tanqr Done A Face Reveal?
