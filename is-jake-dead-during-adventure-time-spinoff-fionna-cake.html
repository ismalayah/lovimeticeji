In the&nbsp;Adventure Time: Distant Lands&nbsp;episode, titled “Obsidian,” the yellow dog was also missing in action and we only saw the human adventurer hanging out with one of Jake’s children. While it was revealed in “Together Again” that he and Jake had died and were then reincarnated, did Jake die during Finn’s adulthood?</p><h2 id=h-where-s-jake-in-the-adventure-time-spin-off-fionna-cake data-injectable=false>Where’s Jake in the Adventure Time spin-off Fionna & Cake?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>In episode two, titled “Simon Petrikov,” Finn was seen without his talking dog partner, Jake. This yellow dog has been with Finn since the pilot episode. Unfortunately, he was nowhere to be seen in the first two episodes of this spin-off and many wondered where he went.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Inverse</a>,&nbsp;Fionna & Cake&nbsp;showrunner, Adam Muto revealed that that they’ve left Jake’s fate ambiguous since “it wasn’t important” for this series. He pointed out that the show had shown Finn and Jake at the end of their lives in previous Adventure Time episodes and believes that showing how and when these two die would be a downer.</p><p>“Yeah. Jake’s current state is probably left the most mysterious out of everybody…</p><p>“…I mean, if there’s a really simple answer to that, I don’t think it would be satisfying. We’ve shown Finn and Jake at the end of their lives. How it resolves. That’s the more important ending to me. You’ve shown them dead, basically. We don’t really show how Finn dies either. The how of it isn’t necessarily as interesting to me to show on screen because that’s kind of a downer.</p><p>“So we left it ambiguous. It wasn’t important for this series.”</p><h2 id=h-so-is-jake-actually-dead data-injectable=false>So… Is Jake actually dead?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>However,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Direct</a>&nbsp;reported that Muto confirmed the pair’s return in&nbsp;Fionna & Cake&nbsp;since he wants to show the differences between Fionna and Cake’s dynamic to Finn and Jake’s. He also believes it wouldn’t make sense if the iconic duo didn’t show up in this show.</p><p>“We do still kind of show a snapshot of them where they’re at because it didn’t make sense to not show them at all. And we also want to see what the contrast is between Finn and Jake and Fionna and Cake’s dynamic. So, yeah, expect to see some versions of them.”</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>So indeed, audiences do see Jake, and Finn as well in the series’ third episode, “Cake the Cat.” They are shown on another adventure of their own, to start things off, but their appearance is somewhat brief. However, it’s never confirmed if these two are the same versions from the initial series or just multiverse variants of these iconic characters, based on the spin-off’s plot.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>All 10 episodes featuring Fionna and Cake the cat, as well as the sightings of Finn and Jake in <a href=#>Adventure Time:&nbsp;Fionna & Cake</a> are streaming on <a href=#>Max</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4yjmKSdXZmyorCMnayroZ6ceqKw1Z6lra2imnq1tcyeZKyomaO8p7KMn6Copp6WeqStyp5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jaeden-martell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jaeden Martell movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-magnificent-seven-2016.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Magnificent Seven movie review (2016)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./has-tanqr-done-a-face-reveal-facts-to-know-about-the-youtuber.html>Has Tanqr Done A Face Reveal?
