Pam Chivers and John Tingle are her parents, and she is their youngest child. During the 1980s, Laura worked as a cadet journalist for the Australian Financial Review after she finished college. She became a news personality then.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=208>Laura Tingle began her career as an economics correspondent for The Australian newspaper in 1987. For an extended period, Sam Neill’s girlfriend alternated between the two news sites. On the other hand, Tingle was named chief political correspondent of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 2018. (ABC) Since then, Laura has been a big part of ABC News. She’s always ready to help when ABC needs her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Laura-Tingle-2-1.jpg><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=209>The journalist may have amassed a sizable fortune due to her illustrious profession. As a result, Laura Tingle’s net worth must be substantial and stable. On the other hand, her partner, Sam Neill, has a net worth of $18 million.</p><h2 class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=210>A Politician’s (Daughter Journalists)</h2><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=211>Laura Tingle is following in the footsteps of her father. Her father, John Saxon Tingle, is a former journalist, broadcaster, and politician from Australia. From 1949 until 1951, he worked as a broadcaster and news editor at Deniliquin. Similarly, he joined ABC in 1951 as a supervisor and chief of staff and remained there until 1968.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=212>Laura Tingle’s father is also a founding member of the Shooters Party, a political party in New South Wales. John was a member of the Democratic Party for eleven years before leaving in 2006. Her father was successful in passing seven bills. He was even named to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal in New South Wales.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=213>When it comes to John’s three kids, Laura is the only one who looks like she’s been following in his footsteps.</p><h2 class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=214>Sam Neill’s writing partner</h2><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=215>Laura, in addition to being a great journalist and presenter, is also a gifted writer. She has written four articles for the Quarterly Essay (an Australian periodical that is a cross between a magazine and a non-fiction book) in which she criticizes the government. Laura has also authored and published two books: In Search of Good Government: Great Expectations and Political Amnesia and Chasing The Future: Recession, Recovery, and Australia’s New Politics. Both of Sam Neill’s girlfriend’s novels have been well-received and discussed by critics. Laura Tingle’s net worth may have arisen due to the sales of these novels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Laura-Tingle-1-1.jpg><h2 class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=217>Alan Ramsey was her husband.</h2><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=218>Laura Tingle, Sam Neill’s partner, married another guy before falling in love with the Jurassic Park star. For nearly three decades, she married the late journalist Alan Graham Ramsey. In an auspicious wedding ceremony in 1995, the pair were wedded. Their marriage, however, did not continue forever, and the couple split in 2017.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=219>Alan Tingle, Laura Tingle’s ex-husband, passed away on November 24, 2020, at 82. He had dementia and spent the latter years of his life in a nursing facility in New South Wales.</p><h2 class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=220>Laura and her ex-husband’s daughter</h2><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=221>Laura and her ex-husband, Alan Ramsey, welcomed a baby daughter, Tosca Ramsey, during their thirty-year marriage. We can notice that she has matured by looking at her images.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=222>Laura’s daughter has an Instagram account, but it is private. She only has 384 followers on Twitter. Tosca, unlike her mother, appears to want to avoid the media and the spotlight. Laura also shared Tosca’s post, in which her daughter said that Alan significantly impacted her life after he died.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=223>She and Sam Neill, her partner, have a son named Tim Neill and a daughter named Elena Neil, whom he welcomed with Lisa Harrow and Noriko Watanabe.</p><h2 class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=224>Sam Neill is in a relationship.</h2><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=225>Laura dated Sam Neill, a Kiwi actor, and director, after her divorce from Alan. The couple began dating in 2017 and have been together since. While Sam was still married to Noriko, the two were kissing in public. Following their divorce, however, Sam and Laura began attending public events and award ceremonies together. In 2021, however, there were a few reports that the two had split up, but neither party confirmed this. However, the two attended a public function the next month, stopping rumors about their breakup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Laura-Tingle-4-1.jpg><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=226>Laura, on the other hand, kept her relationship with Sam secret. Although they were seen together publicly at several events, Laura and Sam never spoke publicly about their relationship. We think Laura is still Sam Neill’s girlfriend, and the two are content with their relationship.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=203><strong>Sam Neill</strong> is a well-known New Zealand actor and businessman. His portrayal as Dr. Alan Grant in the Jurassic Park movies may be familiar to Jurassic Park fans worldwide. He has also appeared in several television series, most notably Peaky Blinders. Sam has also been nominated for three Golden Globes and two Primetime Emmys for his work in the performing arts.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=204>Sam has been in the news recently for his relationship and marriage, in addition to his impressive acting career. From 1980 through 1989, Neill had a brief romance with actress Lisa Harrow. After the divorce, he married Noriko Watanabe, a Japanese make-up artist, and they were married for almost three decades.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=205>Unfortunately, the pair split in 2017, and Sam has been seeing Laura Tingle, an Australian political writer, since then. In today’s article, let’s talk about some intriguing facts about Sam Neill’s partner, Laura Tingle. Is the couple still together?</p><h2 class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=227>Isn’t it strange when there are disputes?</h2><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=228>Laura Tingle has faced many controversies throughout her career as a high-profile journalist. She prefers to speak her opinion and isn’t afraid to say what she thinks. There have been many problems and criticism for Laura because of this. The media and politicians have been very angry with her.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=229>Tingle was elected chair of the National Press Club in 2022. According to Jack Houghton, host of The Media Show, it’s a disgrace. Furthermore, he stated that it is a critical position in journalism that must be handed over to solid hands. He added that Laura, who has called Australia’s prime minister a pompous and ideological bastard, must not get the job. She also publicly addressed Prime Minister Scott Morrison, asking if he would apologize for his sins now that he is Prime Minister. Of course, the media were not pleased, but Morrison embraced the situation and took a fair amount of the flak.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=230>Laura is a prominent and controversial personality in Australian politics and journalism due to her bold and outspoken nature. This attitude, on the other hand, has earned her a large number of fans and followers. With over 35.7K Instagram followers, she is a huge celebrity.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijmq2ilnq1tc2go55lZ2Kzor%2FCoqWarJmjtG6ywJyrrGWRl7y2wIytn55lmqTCs7rApaCsrF2bv7C5jJqsrKyilrmqrY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zahara-marley-jolie-pitt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zahara Marley Jolie-Pitt, Daughter of Angelina Jolie!
